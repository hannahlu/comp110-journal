Is everything a computer? The answer as far as Horsman C et al [1], are concerned, is no; not everything in the universe is acting as a computer.  They argue that declaring everything as a computer, negates the existence of physical computation in its own right and that a framework is needed for determining whether a physical system is performing a computation. The proposed requirements for a physical system to be performing a computation are as follows:

-	 A physical system can only be used as a computer, once we are confident of the physical theory of the device and are confident all the diagrams, proposed by Horsman C et al, commute. 
-	Confidence in the theory, is the confidence that within the known limits of the theory, all inputs and all programs will commute.
-	Central to their argument is the representation relation of the abstract to the physical and vice versa. Computers are used to solve an abstract problem. A physical system needs an abstract problem to be able to be embedded into the abstract description of the physical system. Unlike physics, where abstract entities are formed to represent the physical, computing involves taking an abstract quantity and representing it physically. The theory needs to be strong enough to perform the representation relation in both directions. A computational entity, which is responsible for representation relation, is also needed.
-	Without encoding and decoding, the physical system is not being used as a computer.

In conclusion, for a physical system to be able to perform a computation, the proposed requirements are: a strong physical theory of the computer, which we are confident with and have tested, a computational entity, a representation relation, ability to encode and decode information and one or more fundamental dynamical operations (such as logic gates) which are able to transfer input states to output states. Finally, all these elements need to pass the relevant commuting diagrams proposed.
